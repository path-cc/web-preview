      <div class="content fs-5"><p>Jimena Gonzàlzez Lozano and Aashish Tripathee are 2023’s recipients of the award for the 
advancements their strategic use of high-throughput computing has enabled</p>

<p>David Swanson was a brilliant research professor in computer science and engineering at 
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He was an OSG advocate and champion whose legacy Ronda 
Swanson at the <a href="https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2014/contributions/">2023 High-Throughput Computing (HTC) conference</a> 
said she hopes will live on in science. To further honor Swanson’s legacy, leadership, and 
contributions to distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC), the <a href="https://osg-htc.org/outreach/swanson-award/">OSG David Swanson Award</a> 
was established in 2020. It reflects the OSG School’s emphasis on training people to develop 
their skills in technology and advance science with large-scale computing, OSG research
facilitation lead Christina Koch says.</p>

<p>This year’s recipients are University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Physics observational
cosmology Ph.D. student <a href="https://www.physics.wisc.edu/directory/gonzalez-lozano-jimena/">Jimena Gonzàlez Lozano</a>
and University of Michigan physics post-doctoral research fellow <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/research-fellows/aashisht.html">Aashish Tripathee</a>.</p>

<p>Annually, one or more former students from the <a href="https://osg-htc.org/user-school-2023/">OSG School</a> 
are chosen according to the advancements and research achievements dHTC has enabled for them. 
Koch served on the selection committee for the award and explains the committee looks for 
students who have taken what they learned at the OSG School and achieved great things with it,
like tackling a research problem or writing workflows from scratch after coming in with no experience.</p>

<p>The committee particularly looks for students who have an ongoing relationship with the OSG and 
propel it forward. The awardees are then provided with the opportunity to share their research at
the OSG All Hands Meeting, which is part of the annual HTC conference. This year was the first 
in-person All Hands Meeting. “Getting to hear the researcher talks and present them with the 
award was really meaningful. It’s really nice to have a chance to pause and recognize the reason 
we’re doing all this hard work,” Koch reflects. “To have it in the context of recognizing a really 
wonderful person like David is really meaningful. It’s really like ‘Oh yes, this is why we’re doing
what we’re doing,’ and it’s really rewarding.”</p>

<p>Both Gonzàlez and Tripathee embody what the selection committee looks for, Koch explains. 
“What Jimena learned [from the OSG School] really helped her solve a problem that she wouldn’t 
have been able to solve before. Aashish is tackling both a niche field of research with these 
resources and also has been testing new features for us or letting us know when things aren’t 
working and has had this ongoing relationship with us.”</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LzzBHMr_WRA">Gonàzlez’s research</a> on strong gravitational lenses in the dark energy 
survey implements HTC and machine learning. Strong gravitational lenses can image stars from 
which Gonzàlez can extract the position of the source and the magnification between the images.
From the images, Gonzàlez creates thousands of simulations composed of millions of images while 
constraining the quality of the images. Because of the volume of simulations she needs to train,
Gonzàlez could be left waiting for up to weeks using machine learning — and the tighter constraints, 
the greater the waiting time. This put its own constraints on which properties she could experiment 
with. Some ideas, Gonzàlez says, were impossible to do because she couldn’t do them quickly. 
Implementing HTC shortened the waiting time from days to hours.</p>

<p>The OSG school also impacted other areas of Gonzàlez’s research, including training the machine and 
performing a complete search — each was reduced from long wait times spanning days to years to much 
more manageable wait times of as little as three hours.</p>

<p>As a David Swanson awardee, it’s an honor to be an example of how HTC and the OSG School transformed 
her research, Gonzàlez elaborates. “I couldn’t even explore new ideas [because it could take weeks to 
run one simulation], and it was around that time that I was reading all my emails carefully, and I saw 
the OSG User School announcement,” Gonzàlez remembers. “They did a really good job at describing what 
you would learn and what high-throughput computing is. From that description, I thought that it was 
perfect for me. I applied, and then during the summer of 2021, I learned how to implement it, and it 
was very quick. After the first day, I already knew how to submit a job.”</p>

<p>Gonzàlez will continue to use HTC to model the mass distribution of each galaxy that produces a gravitational
lens. People previously performed the computing for these models by hand, but as the data accumulates, it 
becomes less feasible for humans to do this computing. To remedy this, Gonzàlez will use machine learning 
to do the modeling because it requires a great deal of computational power.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hKA8H7TtMAg">Tripathee uses HTC</a> to research continuous gravitational waves. For one project,
the data he collects spans a year and the entire sky, as well as the polarization over 24 times, resulting in 
number templates of size 8x1016 — or 80 quadrillion templates. On top of this, Tripathee is looking at 500
billion templates. The solution for computing templates at a magnitude to the power of 16 is to use HTC, helping 
with efficiency when running the numbers and making the project possible, Tripathee said at HTC23. Without HTC, 
Tripathee’s jobs would’ve taken on average more than 10 hours for some or more than 24 hours for others. Through 
the OSG, Tripathee uses 22 million core hours, 1.4 million hours per month, and 47,000 hours per day.</p>

<p>CC* coordinator and Tripathee’s mentor Tim Cartwright encouraged Tripathee to self-nominate for the award. 
Upon learning he was chosen to receive the award, Tripathee recalls feeling happy, honored, and excited 
because he knew the history of the award and of David’s legacy.</p>

<p>“It felt like a nice validation and a recognition of having used the [OSG] to perform research,” Tripathee says
about receiving the award. “I also got to meet a lot of people who I only met through e-mail like the OSG faculty,
Tim Cartwright in particular, and Christina. There was a really nice opportunity and an honor to come to Madison,
attend the event, and receive the award but also meet [Ronda Swanson].”</p>

<p>Tripathee plans to continue using the OSG’s resources on new data and to conduct deeper searches more quickly and 
efficiently. “With OSG, we didn’t have to fight and struggle for resources. Having this access to these extra resources 
allowed us to do searches that are more computationally costly and sensitive,” Tripathee says. “If I had never heard
of OSG, I would have probably still performed similar searches but not to this depth or sensitivity because the amount 
of features that I would have had access to would have been more limited.”</p>

<p>“Once I was at [HTC23], I understood what impact he [David Swanson] had on people, and not only in developing OSG,
which was huge,” Gonzàlez notes. “It was shocking, that impact, but it was so very interesting to see people talking
about him because it seemed like he was also a really good human being, a really good mentor, and really 
liked helping people and supporting people.”</p>
